          <p class="contentText">
            It was clear going into the State Trooper Academy that it would be challenging and that I would be pushed both mentally and physically to my limit, but all I knew was that I would do my best to learn. We had no perception of time we were completely isolated from the world and the internet as a whole. 72 hours of overnight nonstop discipline you don't eat until they tell you to eat, you don't sleep until they tell you to, and you don't stop running until they tell you to. It taught everyone one of us how much more we could truly accomplish without our minds in the way. For 16 hours each day for 3 days, we didn't stop, we couldn't sit breaks did not exist we were pushed to our very limits.
          </p>
          <p class="contentText">
            When we began they told us that every person in that room was going to change by the end of the program. At that time I didnâ€™t understand what they meant, but by the end, I believe that every single one of us understood what they meant by that. The program showed us how much we could accomplish, it also showed us how it felt to be uncomfortable, and more importantly, it showed us how to work together. We all were pushed past what we thought we could do, which in turn showed us what we could do. Coming out of the program I look at things differently and it pushes me to work harder and not let my mind get in the way.

          <p class="contentText">
            My Analog Devices Internship was an amazing experience that I will never forget. I learned so much about the tech industry and realized that my curiosity and versatility make me a perfect fit for this field. I was assigned to work on programming streams to a stream bus processor, which triggers commands to other parts on the board. Our team was responsible for the digital front end of the communications chips that will be used in 5g cell towers. We aimed to use Machine Learning Digital Predistortion in order to compensate for charge trapping within GaN Pa power amplifiers which add increased gain to our output signals resulting in a higher error vector magnitude and out-of-band noise. The neural engine in the chip can dynamically adapt the chip's predistortion to allow the PAs to maintain linear power output as the power amplification increases correcting the distortion added to the signal as it is amplified.
          </p>
          <p class="contentText">
            During the internship, the biggest highlight was learning and the environment that I was in. I was constantly surrounded by engineers who were pioneers in their respective industries. This allowed me to ask questions and learn about various fields, as well as see some mathematical applications in engineering. Unlike any other internship I have done before, this one gave me a real insight into the workforce. At times I felt like the tasks I was being asked to do was over my head, but that also showed me the importance of having peers around you to ask questions when you get stuck.
