I am always asking questions and trying to find out how things work. I care deeply for others, always looking for an opportunity to show appreciation for the people in my life. I also love taking things apart and putting them back together, which has led me to pursue a career in mechanical engineering and computer science. But most of all I am always trying to help someone out, whether it be trying to simplify a complicated idea from class to a confused classmate, or a teacher needing technical help in class, whenever I have the ability to help I try to do just that.</p>

        <h2 class="s2header">What do I value?</h2>
        <p class="s2maintext">One of the biggest things that I value is my family. My family is easily the biggest blessing for me growing up, they always made sure that I had everything I needed, they made sure I stayed laser focused on my goals, and more importantly they made sure that I felt loved. My mom always made sure that when I got home from school I had a snack waiting for me, and that I had a nice dinner to eat at night. My father has taught me how to be handy since I was a kid, which is the reason for all my mechanical inclination today to pursue in the field of computer science. Growing up in the city isn't easy, and plenty of my friends have made the wrong decisions getting caught up in the moment. But arguably enough the way I was raised by my parents is the reason why I was able to make it out of a difficult environment even when it was always easier to do the wrong thing.</p>

          <h2 class="s2header">What is my passion?</h2>
          <p class="s2maintext">Today, I have truly immersed myself in computer science. I use my curiosity to fuel my drive into computer science. I love the field of computer science because there are almost unlimited things to question and learn. But another thing that I found powerful in computer science was the ability to use computer science to help others in need. I began to use my skills in computer science to make websites and companies to help those in need. One of my first projects was creating a website for Hinche Marathon Organization, my website sought to bring light to the work that they do for children in poverty in Haiti and help carry their efforts further through a modern website. I also used my knowledge of computer science to create a clothing line No Bounds Clothing to give back to communities in need, but also spread positivity. Over time I have been able to develop my curiosity to the point where I am able to focus on a field and immerse myself in it and truly learn everything that crosses my mind.</p>

            <p class="s2maintext">In order to achieve these long-term goals, I need to focus on my technical skills and making sure that I am keeping up with the latest trends in software engineering. I also need to make sure that I am networking and building relationships with people who can help me achieve my goals. Additionally, I need to continue to develop my business skills so that I am able to successfully launch and grow my own software company.</p>
